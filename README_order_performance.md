# Order History Performance Improvements

## Optimizations Made

### 1. Caching System for Orders
- Added in-memory caching to OrdersController to reduce duplicate Firestore queries
- Implemented cache expiration with time-based invalidation
- StreamController caching for efficient stream management

### 2. Order Detail Optimizations
- Added lazy loading for order items (only showing first 3 items with "View more" option)
- Optimized order detail fetching with timing measurements
- Added better error handling and debug logging

### 3. UI Performance
- Improved loading indicators with more user-friendly messages
- Made the OrderTabPage a StatefulWidget with AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin to preserve tab state
- Added proper resources cleanup with dispose() methods

### 4. Stream Management
- Static OrdersController instance to avoid creating multiple instances
- Better error handling in streams with fallback mechanisms
- Added debug logging for performance tracking

## Technical Impact

1. **Memory Usage**: Reduced by implementing proper caching and dispose methods
2. **Query Efficiency**: Decreased duplicate queries to Firestore
3. **Loading Speed**: Improved through lazy loading of order items and optimized stream handling
4. **User Experience**: Enhanced with better feedback during loading states

## Implementation Notes

The system now:
- Only loads necessary data when needed
- Preserves order data between tab switches
- Shows optimized order details with option to view all items
- Provides meaningful performance metrics and logging
- Properly cleans up resources when screens are closed

## Future Improvements

1. Implement pagination for orders in each tab
2. Add offline support with local database caching
3. Further optimize image loading in order items
